                    if you're not convinced, read on down below. or, send me a video of yourself skiing at tmuntia@gmail.com.
                    i'll review it for free if you let me post it here as well, or for $50 if you want it shared privately.

                <h2>qualifications</h2>
                <p>
                    i was one of of the youngest certified psia level 3 instructors at age 17. now i am old and washed up.
                    in all seriousness i have designed, created, and run trainings for other instructors to pass upper level
                    certification exams. in other words, i regularly coach expert skiers to refine and elevate their skiing.
                    and i'm <i>really</i> good at it.
                </p>
                <h2>method</h2>
                <p>
                    skiing isn't rocket science. i know because i was once trained by a rocket scientist and he was pretty clear
                    about it (and unsurprisingly, he was the best trainer i've ever had). but it <b>is</b> technical.
                </p>
                <p>    
                    i will tell you specifically what is 
                    inefficient about your skiing, and then precisely describe both the movements that we want instead and also
                    <b>how</b> we will introduce those movements to your skiing. if i ever give you any sort of feedback as vague
                    as "nice turns" or "get forward" feel free to slap me with maximum force.
                </p>
                <p>
                    advanced and expert skiers can ski. but while they can ski, they ski mostly from habit and not always
                    from good ones. my job is to explain habits. i take movements that you make without realizing them and 
                    let you make them consciously, easily, and on command. sometimes, we need new movements that i help 
                    introduce, but most of the time i am trying to find analogs that exist in your skiing and just surface them
                    to you. 
                <p>
                    in other words, out of the chaos that is your skiing, i give you tools to ski more confidently, easily,
                    gracefully, and aggressively. because usually the only thing in the way of your skiing is your brain.
                </p>
                <h2>video</h2>
                <p>
                    in my opinion video is the single most useful tool we have to improve skiing. it is almost impossible
                    to understand how you move while you ski without it, especially when you ski with ingrained habits 
                    (i.e., as long as you're not a beginner).
                </p>
                <p>
                    i almost always carry a gopro on me when skiing, and always do while teaching. you don't need a psychologist
                    or a neuroscientist to tell you that when you see what movements you make, you are more capable of repeating
                    and changing them. monkey see monkey do.
