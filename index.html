                    i'm a growth engineer at <a href="https://www.getmagical.com">magical</a>
                    where i work mostly on onboarding and new ways to encourage user engagement
                    with our product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    previously i worked at insight partners and palm drive capital as an investment analyst,
                    as well as in a computational neuroscience lab at dartmouth, where i was a math major
                    (good math, good times). at that time i was also a venture partner for contrary capital.
                </p>
                <h2>ski work</h2>
                <p>
                    i've also spent a lot of time teaching skiing. i finished my final level of certification
                    when i was 17, and since then have been coaching and preparing instructors for their certifications,
                    and of course teaching advanced and expert students. i was briefly director of the dartmouth
                    ski school where i hired and trained a fresh new cohort of instructors, as well as set
                    standards for lessons. 
                <p>
                    safe to say i'm pretty good at making people ski better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    this season, i am teaching part-time at <a href="https://www.snowbird.com">snowbird</a>.
                    if you want to <a href="https://tickets.snowbird.com/mountainschool/ItemList.aspx?node_id=4938813">ski with me</a>

                <h2>not work</h2>
                <p>
                    in my free time i like to play outside. i ski, climb, and
                    mountain bike. i like to take my old minolta srt201 35mm film camera with me and take
                    terrible photos. indoors, i also enjoy playing aggressive chess via dubious
                    gambits, usually losing at poker, and iterating iterating iterating on dishes the 
                    same way we iterate on onboarding at magical.
